# 🔐 BB84 Quantum Cryptography Simulation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol used for secure communication between two parties — Alice and Bob.

The BB84 protocol enables secure key exchange using principles of quantum mechanics and helps detect eavesdropping attempts.

## 🧠 About BB84 Protocol
BB84 is a quantum cryptography protocol proposed in 1984 by Charles H. Bennett and Gilles Brassard.

It uses:
- Random bit generation
- Random basis selection (+ and ×)
- Quantum transmission
- Basis comparison over classical channel
- QBER (Quantum Bit Error Rate) calculation
- Eavesdropping detection
